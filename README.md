DevOps Playground by Kevin Kim

==================================================

Topics to cover
1. Infrastructure as Code - Terraform & Terragrunt
2. Container Orchestration -  Kubernetes & Docker
3. Python
4. CI/CD - GitHub Actions
5. Infra Monitoring - Grafana & Prometheus
6. Logs Management - Loki
7. Configuration Management - Ansible

==================================================

Objectives
1. Environment Parity
    Dev/Staging/Production should have the almost the same configurations/setup
2. Infrastructure as Code
    Environments can be taken down and spun back up without losing anything
3. CICD
    Maintain repo security, set up a simple deployment pipeline via GitHub Actions
4. Monitoring/Logging
    Set up dashboards for monitoring/logging stack and alerts for downtime
